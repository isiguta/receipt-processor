# Receipt Processor take home assignment

Hi!

That's a take home assignment for Backend Engineer.
Original task description is here: https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge

Assignment is written in Go.
Docker file provided.

A couple of unit tests are there as well.

1. clone code.
2. navigate into a folder with code.
3. run `go run .`
4. server should be listening on localhost:8088

Alternatively, one could build and run a docker image.

I appreciate you time and consideration! Would be happy to answer any question.

Igor.
